# Known Issues

## OPEN

### P0 — Aadhaar KYC image still in git history on origin/development
`aadhaar_front_1788186479093.jpg` (a real Aadhaar ID card image) was committed at the
repo root in `39f8427` and pushed to `origin/development`. Per user decision on
2026-09-13, only the working-tree copy was removed (commit `4d20b0b` on `Frontend`) —
**the file is still recoverable from git history and from `origin/development`**.
User explicitly declined a history purge for now ("just remove going forward").
Revisit: if this repo is or becomes public, or if compliance requires it, this needs
`git filter-repo` + coordinated force-push to fully scrub it. Do not do this
unilaterally — it rewrites shared history every collaborator must re-sync from.
See [decisions.md](decisions.md).

### P2 — loopo-client has no ESLint config
`npx eslint .` in `loopo-client` fails immediately with "couldn't find an
eslint.config.*" (ESLint v9+ flat-config required, none present). `package.json` has
no `lint` script either, unlike `loopo-backend` and `loopo-admin`. Not a build
blocker (`next build` passes clean either way), but there's currently zero lint
signal on this app. Not fixed this session — needs a deliberate flat-config choice
(what plugin/rule set) rather than a rushed default.

### P2 — loopo-admin has ~197 pre-existing `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` lint errors
Plus one `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` in `AuthProvider.tsx` (a normal
localStorage-hydration-on-mount pattern — likely a non-issue, not confirmed broken).
Does not block `next build` (Next 16 doesn't run ESLint during build by default here).
Real code-quality debt, but 197 findings is deliberately **not** being bulk-fixed
under deadline pressure — see [decisions.md](decisions.md).

### Not yet audited
Everything not explicitly listed under RESOLVED below is simply **not yet checked**:
runtime behavior of auth/chat/search/moderation flows, cross-platform API-contract
consistency (client/admin/flutter vs actual backend DTOs), Prisma migration drift,
seed data, CI workflows, env/secret handling, mobile builds (analyzed only, not built).

## RESOLVED (this session, 2026-09-13)

- **Sensitive file exposure**: Aadhaar image removed from working tree (see OPEN item
  above — history purge still pending, not done).
- **loopo-backend**: 4 TS2349 errors in `test/analytics.e2e-spec.ts` (wrong supertest
  import style vs. every other e2e spec). Fixed. `tsc --noEmit` now 0 errors.
- **loopo-admin**: 115 TypeScript build errors, root-caused to MUI v6 legacy `Grid` vs
  `Grid2` API mismatch across 14 pages, plus 3 unrelated real bugs (KYC status-filter
  dead-code branches causing admins to miss UNDER_REVIEW submissions when filtering by
  "Pending"; missing `Shield` icon import in complaints detail page; duplicate
  `borderRadius` key in `EmailTemplateSidebar.tsx`). All fixed; `next build` passes with
  `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors` removed (it had been silently masking all of the above).
- **loopo-client**: `next build` and `tsc --noEmit` both clean as-is (including current
  WIP: mockData removal, new `src/types/`).
- **loopo-flutter**: `flutter analyze` clean (4 info-level style notes only, no errors).
